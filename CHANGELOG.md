## Unreleased
- fix(gitbutler): completed worktree tasks now auto-prune their aid-owned worktrees by default when the branch has committed changes, while preserving failed tasks, shared worktrees, and projects with `keep_worktrees_after_done = true`
- fix(batch): `aid batch` now offers a one-time GitButler enable prompt for detected GitButler repos without `.aid/project.toml` integration, with `suppress_gitbutler_prompt = true` and `--yes` / `--no-prompt` escape hatches for non-interactive runs
- fix(gitbutler): batch completion and `aid watch --quiet --group` now surface the GitButler lane merge-back path via `aid merge --lanes --group <wg-id>`
- docs: add `docs/gitbutler.md` covering modes, batch review flow, `AID_GITBUTLER=0`, troubleshooting, and `keep_worktrees_after_done`

## v8.93.0 (2026-04-18)
- feat(release): `scripts/release.sh` now pre-flights orphan branch and orphan worktree detection. Branches merged into `main` and worktrees pointing at merged or missing branches block the release unless `--skip-hygiene` is passed. Dry-run mode only warns.
- feat(hygiene): new `scripts/session-preflight.sh` surveys repo health at session start — fetch, ahead/behind vs `origin/main`, dirty count, aid zombie tasks, aid worktrees for current repo, /tmp disk usage. Wired as a Claude Code SessionStart hook when `.claude/settings.json` enables it locally.
- docs: `docs/ux-debt.md` records 14 UX debt items grouped by severity plus five non-negotiable principles (resource lifecycle, path-relative-to-file, cross-repo safety, error translation at config layer, board truthfulness) for the v9.0 overhaul.
- docs: `docs/roadmap.md` and `docs/design/reply-unstick-spec.md` track the unreleased port work (reply/unstick/GH#89 background preflight) and the v9.0 plan. The reply/unstick feature spec is preserved for the follow-up port — see `ai-board` item `wi-273e`.


## v8.92.0 (2026-04-17)
- fix(verify): detect when a task prompt declares new files (`Create a NEW file: <path>`) but the resulting commit does not add them — verify now fails with the missing paths instead of silently passing (closes #103)
- feat(doctor): new `aid doctor` sub-command lists prunable worktrees and deletable merged/rebased branches under aid-managed prefixes; `--apply` runs `git worktree prune` + `git branch -d` (never `-D`)
- feat(auto-gc): opt-in auto cleanup of fully-merged task worktrees + branches on task/group completion via `--auto-gc` flag or `aid_gc = "auto"` in `.aid/project.toml` (closes #104)


## v8.91.1 (2026-04-17)
- fix(rescue): never amend tagged release commits — creates a new commit on top instead when HEAD has any tag (closes #102)
- fix(rescue): honor pre-task dirty-file baseline so the user's pre-existing uncommitted work is never staged/committed by rescue
- fix(rescue): exclude aid-internal artifacts (`.aid/`, `result-t-*.md`) from rescue staging
- fix(rescue): baseline handles rename/delete/kind-transition status lines correctly (path-only match)


## v8.91.0 (2026-04-16)
- refactor: split delivery assessment from verify status and persist it as first-class task metadata, including migration of legacy hollow-output and empty-diff states
- refactor: add a shared worktree snapshot boundary and reuse it across dirty checks, post-run settlement, commit, and rescue flows
- refactor: extract lifecycle phase decisions for teardown, escape checks, worktree settlement, verify/scope handling, checklist handling, and task post-processing
- fix: isolate agent rate-limit marker tests and ignore local `.aic/` audit artifacts so release status checks stay clean
- chore: unblock release gates by sharing Gemini-family support code through one module path and making the current clippy warning policy explicit


## v8.90.0 (2026-04-16)
- fix: `aid board` anti-poll enforcement strengthened — blocked states no longer output board data, repeat limit lowered to 1, hard blocks exit with code 1, hints include running task IDs


## v8.89.0 (2026-04-14)
- fix(#102): `should_rescue_path` no longer excludes `result-*.md` files — audit/cross-audit tasks that write result files are now properly rescued instead of triggering a guaranteed dirty-worktree FAIL
- fix(#102): `persist_result_file` now runs before Failed-task worktree cleanup, so result files are saved to `~/.aid/tasks/<id>/` while the worktree still exists


## v8.88.0 (2026-04-14)
- fix(#99): `prompt_scan.rs` no longer panics on multi-byte UTF-8 characters (em-dashes, arrows, etc.) in context files during `--dry-run`. Replaced byte-based `truncate()` with char-based truncation in `truncate_snippet`.
- fix(#97): batch cost total no longer double-counts — was exactly 2x the real sum because `waiting_ids` and dispatched `task_ids` overlapped. Now deduplicates before summing.
- fix(#96): `read_only = true` + `worktree` combination in batch TOML is now caught at parse/dry-run time with a clear error, instead of silently failing at dispatch after 30+ minutes.
- fix(#100): batch `--parallel` no longer serializes same-agent tasks. The auto-concurrency cap was limited to unique agent count (1 for all-codex batches); now uses CPU-based `recommended_max_concurrent` (4-24) capped at task count.
- fix(#101): `aid group finding add` no longer fails when called by codex agents in background tasks. Stopped auto-reading stdin (which is `/dev/null` in background) when content arg is missing; now requires explicit `--stdin` flag.


## v8.87.0 (2026-04-12)
- fix(#95): stop silent data loss when agents forget to `git add` new files. aid already ran `rescue_untracked_files` post-agent, but the defense had four gaps: it only handled `??` untracked files (modified-but-unstaged tracked files fell through), it amended the last commit and silently failed when the agent made zero commits, `git status --porcelain` collapsed fully-untracked directories to `src/` hiding individual files, and there was no final assertion before marking the task DONE. Now `rescue_dirty_worktree` (new, in `src/commit/rescue.rs`) covers both untracked and modified tracked files, uses `--untracked-files=all`, creates a fresh commit when HEAD is empty, and emits loud milestone events. A shared `post_agent_dirty_worktree_cleanup` helper runs rescue → retry → final assertion on BOTH the foreground (`aid run`) and background (`aid run --bg`) paths; if the worktree is still dirty after rescue and retry, the task transitions to Failed with a listing of remaining paths instead of silently losing them on worktree cleanup. Read-only audit tasks bypass the assertion by design. The injected `[Git Staging Rule]` prompt wording is now explicit: agents are told to run `git status --porcelain` before every commit and that any task leaving unstaged files will FAIL. Closes #95.
- feat(#98): opt-in `--audit` flag on `aid run` that dispatches `aic audit <task-id>` as a foreground subprocess when a task reaches DONE. Captures verdict (`pass` / `fail` / `error` / `skipped`) and report path as task metadata (`audit_verdict`, `audit_report_path`) and surfaces `Audit: <verdict> (report: <path>)` in `aid show` output when populated. Graceful degradation when `aic` is not on PATH — warning logged, verdict set to `skipped`, task status unaffected (audit is strictly informational; parent task status never changes based on auditor verdict). Configurable via `[audit] auto = true` in `.aid/project.toml` for per-project auto-audit, with a `--no-audit` CLI escape hatch to opt individual tasks out. Batch TOML supports `audit` at `[defaults]` and per-`[[task]]` levels with task-level overrides. Timeout default 5 minutes, configurable via `AID_AUDIT_TIMEOUT_SECS` up to 30 minutes. Closes #98.
- chore: split oversized touched files into submodules while fixing #98 — `src/types.rs` 795 → 67 lines (Task struct moved to `src/types/task.rs`), `src/project.rs` 581 → 296 lines (audit/team config extracted), `src/batch.rs` 575 → 170 lines (TOML schema and validate helpers extracted). Shared test env lock `crate::aic::test_env_lock` eliminates a race between `src/aic.rs` tests and `src/cmd/run_audit_tests.rs` tests that was producing flaky failures under parallel execution.


## v8.86.0 (2026-04-12)
- feat(qwen): add Qwen Code CLI (`qwen`) as a first-class aid agent. Qwen Code 0.14.x is a Gemini-CLI fork with identical stream-json output schema, so the adapter mirrors the Gemini one (stream events, tool call classification, token accounting). Default model is `coder-model`; free-tier pricing via OAuth or Alibaba Cloud Coding Plan. `aid run qwen "..."`, `aid batch` with `agent = "qwen"`, stats, board, and smart routing all work. Wired through `AgentKind`, adapter registry, selection scoring, cost table, rate limit tracking, container/sandbox matrix, and config models.
- fix(#94): strengthen worktree validation and stop running `but setup` inside task worktrees. `is_valid_git_worktree` previously accepted any git repo at the expected path — a standalone repo squatting `/tmp/aid-wt-*` would be silently reused forever, breaking merge-back. It now also requires the candidate's `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` to match the main repo's common dir AND the canonicalized path to appear in `git worktree list --porcelain` (with `/tmp` ↔ `/private/tmp` symlink aliasing handled). Separately, `run_dispatch_prepare` no longer calls `but setup` inside per-task worktrees — `but setup` requires the main worktree and the call was the most plausible trigger for the initial mutation. GitButler hooks now only wire for tasks when the main repo already has an active GitButler project; otherwise aid emits a one-shot hint telling you to run `but setup` from the main repo. Closes #94.
- chore: gitignore `.aid-verify-deps-state` and `result-t-*.md` so transient verify state and audit result files don't leak into commits.


## v8.85.0 (2026-04-11)
- fix(#91): detect nested git repos at dispatch time and warn loudly when the inner-vs-outer repo choice is ambiguous. New `--repo-root <path>` flag on `aid run` and `aid batch` (also `[defaults] repo_root = "..."` in batch TOML) to override auto-detection. Non-submodule nesting triggers a warning that names both repos, their remotes, and the exact override commands.
- fix(#92): `aid batch` / `aid run --worktree` now reconciles reused worktrees with the current branch HEAD before dispatch. When the reused worktree is behind and has no local edits, it is fast-forwarded automatically; otherwise dispatch fails with an actionable error (`aid worktree remove <branch>` hint). Verify-failure errors that were actually caused by a missing task directory inside a stale worktree now surface the real cause instead of a generic "verify failed".
- fix(#93): fresh worktrees no longer fail verify because `node_modules` / `target` / `.venv` are missing. New `setup` hook field in `.aid/project.toml`, batch `[defaults]`, and `[[task]]` — runs once per worktree (cached via `.aid-setup-done` marker) and streams output as `setup` events. When `setup` is not defined, aid falls back to symlinking well-known dependency dirs (`node_modules`, `target`, `.venv`, `venv`, `vendor`) from the main repo into the worktree, gated by a matching project file. Disable with `--no-link-deps` on `aid run` or `[defaults] worktree_link_deps = false`. Verify failures in fresh worktrees now append a hint pointing at the `setup` field.


## v8.84.0 (2026-04-10)
- fix(batch-retry): `aid batch retry <wg>` now serializes retried tasks that share a worktree. Tasks are bucketed by `(worktree_path, worktree_branch)`; buckets with more than one task dispatch sequentially and wait for each task to reach a terminal status before starting the next. Distinct worktrees still retry in parallel. Previously, shared-worktree tasks all dispatched concurrently and trampled each other.
- fix(commit): post-task `auto_commit` no longer scoops `.aid-lock`, `result-*.md`, or `aid-batch-*.toml` into stray commits. `git add -u` uses pathspec exclusion, untracked-file detection filters `result-*.md`, and the commit is skipped entirely via `git diff --cached --quiet` when nothing substantive is staged. Eliminates the "sandwich auto-commit" noise that every feature branch used to accumulate.


## v8.83.0 (2026-04-10)
- feat(gitbutler): opt-in GitButler integration. New `[project] gitbutler = "off" | "auto" | "always"` field, auto-detected by `aid project init` when the `but` CLI is present.
- feat(gitbutler): per-dispatch worktree integration — `but setup` runs in the worktree, Claude Code agents get `.claude/settings.local.json` with `but claude pre-tool|post-tool|stop` hooks, and non-Claude agents get an on-done `but -C <wt> commit -i` chained into `args.on_done`. Gated on `AID_GITBUTLER=0` escape hatch.
- feat(gitbutler): `aid merge --group <wg-id> --lanes` applies each task branch as a GitButler virtual branch lane instead of sequentially `git merge`-ing them, so a whole batch becomes a single reviewable workspace via `but status` / `but apply` / `but unapply`. Worktrees are preserved in `--lanes` mode.
- fix(background): `build_on_done_command` now routes commands containing shell metacharacters (`&&`, `||`, `|`, `;`, `>`, `<`, backticks, `$(`) through `sh -c` instead of naive `split_whitespace` + `Command::new`. Makes chained on_done commands actually work for any aid user, not just GitButler.
- fix(merge): `--lanes --check` and `--lanes --target` now return clear errors instead of silently ignoring the flag; `--lanes` without `--group` still errors cleanly. All three combinations have unit tests.
- fix(merge): `aid merge --group --lanes` now honors `AID_GITBUTLER=0` and the project `gitbutler` mode — previously the env var only gated dispatch hooks, letting `--lanes` still run.
- docs: new "GitButler Integration (optional)" section in CLAUDE.md covering modes, per-task behavior, escape hatch, and `--lanes` post-batch assembly.

- feat: Prompt injection scanning — context files and skills scanned for adversarial patterns (role hijacking, system prompt injection, invisible Unicode, XML tag injection) with warnings
- feat: Smart model routing — automatically uses cheaper models for simple prompts without --budget flag, configurable via `selection.smart_routing` (default: enabled), conservative heuristic (length, word count, code blocks, keywords)
- feat: Shared `embed_context_in_prompt` helper — context files now embedded in prompts for codex, cursor, oz, and codebuff agents (previously silently dropped)
- fix: Cursor read-only mode now passes `--trust` flag — fixes workspace trust prompt blocking plan-mode tasks

## v8.77.0 (2026-04-08)
- Strengthen anti-polling: remove `--force` bypass hints from board messages, add 30s force cooldown, escalating resistance (hard block after 3+ force calls in 2min)


## v8.76.0 (2026-04-08)
